[jrhizor.dev](https://jrhizor.dev) is Jared Rhizor's personal site and blog.

The site is powered by Hugo, GitHub Pages, and Cloudflare. It supports comments via GitHub Issues.

The markdown and Hugo files are on the [`source`](https://github.com/jrhizor/jrhizor.github.io/tree/source) branch. When the [`source`](https://github.com/jrhizor/jrhizor.github.io/tree/source) branch changes, a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/jrhizor/jrhizor.github.io/actions) will automatically push the rendered version of the site to the [`master`](https://github.com/jrhizor/jrhizor.github.io/tree/master) branch.

CloudFlare mirrors [jrhizor.github.io](http://jrhizor.github.io) to [jrhizor.dev](https://jrhizor.dev) with caching/SSL and provides analytics.
