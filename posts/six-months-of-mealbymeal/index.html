logging foods over voice is useful. Here&rsquo;s what I learned over the course of the last six months and tracking thousands of meals and close to a million user calories.</p><h3 id=1-easy-logging-encourages-retention>1. Easy logging encourages retention</h3><p>Retention is critical because MyFitnessPal is an advertising behemoth. They expect users to churn after a couple months, but they can keep themselves as the default option anyone looking for a calorie tracker by spending a ton of money on ads. This allows them to market to users at the right moment when they start looking for a calorie tracking or weiht loss option, and makes it very expensive for competitors to compete on paid marketing to acquire users. You need a niche or a unique distribution channel.</p><p>So one way to make user acquisition cost-effective is to increase the average subscription length. For MealByMeal, I bet that easier logging would help retain users. I found this to be mostly true. If users didn&rsquo;t churn from the trial, ~<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of users maintained their subscriptions over multiple months.</p><h3 id=2-texting-is-a-great-way-to-track-calories>2. Texting is a great way to track calories</h3><p>I&rsquo;m convinced that texting was the wrong approach. It costs more and has a lot of red tape. It&rsquo;s also dangerous to use a chatbot. If a user convinces a bot to say something bad, you may get flagged and penalized.</p><p>Some competitors have recently launched that use Telegram / WhatsApp, but those are a bit more limited in terms of user base. Also, most people think of calorie counters as apps, so if you need to explain a different (non-standard) model, it harms user acquisition.</p><p>I will likely launch an app version of MealByMeal to mitigate a lot of these problems and allow building a great UX around the text-based infrastructure.</p><h3 id=3-logging-foods-over-voice-is-useful>3. Logging foods over voice is useful</h3><p>I haven&rsquo;t explored this enough yet. Most of my users log by typing and not by saying &ldquo;hey siri, text mealbymeal that I had a banana&rdquo;. Even the big players like MyFitnessPal don&rsquo;t have Siri integrations, which seems a bit crazy.</p><p>I haven&rsquo;t had much success yet in marketing MealByMeal towards people that would benefit most from this, but it&rsquo;s a work in progress.</p><hr><p>To follow my journey building <a href=https://www.mealbymeal.com>MealByMeal</a>, please <a href=https://twitter.com/jaredrhizor>follow me on Twitter</a>.</p></div></main></body></html>
