  <p>I've been building massive data pipelines at <a href="https://liveramp.com/">LiveRamp</a> for most of the last five years, where I was the tech lead responsible for a PB-scale device graph. Now I'm on a few month hiatus spending time coding, traveling, reading, and writing.</p>
  <p>At LiveRamp, I worked throughout the distributed system stack: Java, Hadoop, Cascading, Thrift RPC services, Docker, Kubernetes, Consul, ZooKeeper, KV Stores, streaming systems, and build tooling. I also have experience hiring, mentoring, and setting technical direction.</p>
  <p>My next role will be at an early stage startup.</p>
