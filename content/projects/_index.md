# Projects

## Current Focus

### [KeywordGems](https://keywordgems.com/)
Automatic, comprehensive keyword research for SEO.

## Active

### [MealByMeal](https://mealbymeal.com/)
Track calories and macros over text message.

### [Poach](https://poach.vc/)
Find early stage founders by tracking the best VCs.

### [Otamatunes](https://otamatunes.com/)

### [Invite](https://invite.sh/)
Easily create calendar events in any timezone.

### [RobinWords](https://robinwords.com/)
Fun word game with a daily challenge.

## Shelved

### [Elmo](https://www.elmohq.com/)
Understand what LLMs think about your brand and products. While the analytics are interesting and can inform strategy, without search volume, it's hard to integrate this into day-to-day work for users.

### [Altnado](https://www.altnado.com/)
Generate alt text for images directly in your CMS. The non-plugin installation approach did not resonate with users. It's also hard to attribute SEO differences specifically to adding alt text. The people that really need this are large e-commerce brands with millions of SKUs.

### [Stoat](https://stoat.dev/)
Helped developers understand their build artifacts and build metrics. If this was built into GitHub people would love it, but selling it as a separate product proved to be a challenge.

### [PresetBot](https://www.presetbot.com/)
Applied Lightroom presets with an API. You can read about why PresetBot failed in [this blog post](/posts/building-a-waitlist-the-wrong-way/).

### [AudienceGarden](https://www.audiencegarden.com/)
Helped grow your following on Twitter via replies. Abandonded due to high costs, long ramp up time to build credibility, and significant platform risk.

### [Interlinked](https://www.interlinked.fyi/)
Compared connector coverage across data integration platforms. There's definitely value in understanding the feature space of connectors, but accurately synthesizing the data is difficult and finding people at exactly the right time during the purchasing process is even more difficult.

### [WithCalories](https://withcalories.com/)
Directory of restaurants in San Francisco with calorie information on the menu. This drove a small amount of traffic to MealByMeal.

### [Vinyl Inspector](https://www.vinylinspector.com/)
Chrome extension to better visually inspect photos of records on eBay to see if they are scratched. Built for a specific  online community that ultimately hated it. 

### [Elelem](https://github.com/jrhizor/elelem)
A simple LLM framework in TypeScript with OpenTelemetry baked in. This was built for MealByMeal before other frameworks had nice interfaces for working with multiple LLM providers and tracing, but Vercel's [AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/) and others are much better now and should be used instead.

### [Fauna](https://fauna.so/)
A simple store featuring products with AI-generated art. It was used for experimenting with Facebook ads.
