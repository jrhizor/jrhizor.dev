          Understand what LLMs think about your brand and products. While the
          analytics are interesting and can inform strategy, without search
          volume, it&apos;s hard to integrate this into day-to-day work for users.

          Generate alt text for images directly in your CMS. The non-plugin
          installation approach did not resonate with users. It&apos;s also hard to
          attribute SEO differences specifically to adding alt text. The people
          that really need this are large e-commerce brands with millions of
          SKUs.

          Compared connector coverage across data integration platforms. There&apos;s
          definitely value in understanding the feature space of connectors, but
          accurately synthesizing the data is difficult and finding people at
          exactly the right time during the purchasing process is even more
          difficult.
